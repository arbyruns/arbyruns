### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

Thanks for stopping by! I'm a self taught iOS developer and I reside outside of Charlotte, NC. For the last 3 years I've released a handful of apps and with each one I learn something new and question what I was doing in the last app I developed ğŸ˜€.

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [MilHub](https://milhub.app/).

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more indepth parts of Swift 

ğŸ“« How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/revansii/) or [The bird app](https://twitter.com/rb_e2)

âš¡ Fun fact: I like to run
