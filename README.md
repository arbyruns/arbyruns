### Hi there 👋

Thanks for stopping by! I'm a self taught iOS developer and I reside outside of Charlotte, NC. For the last 3 years I've released a handful of apps and with each one I learn something new and question what I was doing in the last app I developed 😀.

🔭 I’m currently working on [MilHub](https://milhub.app/).

🌱 I’m currently learning more indepth parts of Swift 

📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/revansii/) or [The bird app](https://twitter.com/rb_e2)

⚡ Fun fact: I like to run
